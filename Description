Portfolio of Riteesh Preetam Nallana
A clean, modern single-page web portfolio built to showcase my work, skills, and professional story. It features a visually engaging UI/UX design with graphic-rich elements and clearly segmented sections: about me, projects, skills, experience, and contact. The design is responsive and polished, emphasising accessibility and readability.

Key highlights:

Highlights a range of technical projects (web development, object recognition, neural-net experiments, UI dashboard builds)

Strong focus on UI/UX design—high-quality graphics and centred content layout

Built to reflect the same high standard I apply in my code and applications

Easily maintained and scalable as I continue to add new work
